  I've been starting so many NestJS projects lately. Now it's time to create a template and share it with the world.

## Features

- Automatic NodeJS version control through [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) 😎
- Prettier for making it pretty 👦
- [Airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb)-based ESLint for keeping it consistent ⚡
- `.editorconfig` for making it cross-IDE ✅
- Automatic import sorting and grouping 💪
- VSCode config to kickstart all the linters and prettiers using `formatOnSave` 🤤
- Winston powered logging. Formatted and colored for devs, forced JSON for machines 😏
- Strictly typed handcrafted config service 👽
